# BMI Calculator v2

# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.
# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Equal to or over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Equal to or over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Equal to or over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Equal to or over 35 they are clinically obese.

# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

# Example Input 1
# 1.50
# 63
# Example Output 1
# Your BMI is 28.0, you are slightly overweight.
# since 63 ÷ (1.50 x 1.50) = 28
# The testing code will check for print output that is formatted like one of the lines below:
# "Your BMI is 18.28678, you are underweight."
# "Your BMI is 22.0, you have a normal weight."
# "Your BMI is 28.50752, you are slightly overweight."
# "Your BMI is 32.56189, you are obese."
# "Your BMI is 37.50000, you are clinically obese."
# Example Input 2
# 1.60
# 96
# Example Output 2
# Your BMI is 37.49999999999999, you are clinically obese.
# Example Input 3
# 1.71
# 73
# Example Output 3
# Your BMI is 24.96494647925858, you have a normal weight.

# Enter your height in meters e.g., 1.55
height = float(input())
# Enter your weight in kilograms e.g., 72
weight = int(input())

bmi = weight / (height * height)
