# Instructions
# Read this the code in main.py
# Spot the problems 🐞.
# Modify the code to fix the program.
# No shortcuts - don't copy-paste to replace the code entirely with a working solution.
# The code needs to print the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

# Your program should print each number from 1 to x where x is the input number.

# However when the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

# When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".

# And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz".

# Hint
# There is more than one fix required.

for number in range(1, target + 1):

    print("FizzBuzz")
  elif number % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
  elif number % 5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
  else:
    print(number)
