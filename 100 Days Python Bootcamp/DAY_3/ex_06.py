# love calculator.

# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
# To work out the love score between two people:
# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:

# "Your score is *x*, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:

# "Your score is *y*, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:

# "Your score is *z*."
# e.g:
# name1 = "Angela Yu"
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"
# T occurs 0 times
# R occurs 1 time
# U occurs 2 times
# E occurs 2 times

# Total = 5

# L occurs 1 time
# O occurs 0 times
# V occurs 0 times
# E occurs 2 times

# Total = 3

# Love Score = 53

# Print: "Your score is 53."

# Example Input 1
# Kanye West
# Kim Kardashian
# Example Output 1
# The Love Calculator is calculating your score...
# Your score is 42, you are alright together.
