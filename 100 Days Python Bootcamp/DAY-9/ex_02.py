# You are going to write a program that adds to a travel_log. You can see a travel_log which is a List that contains 2 Dictionaries. Your job is to create a function that can add new countries to this list.

# Write a function that will work with the following line of code on line 21 to add the entry for Brazil to the travel_log.

# add_new_country("Brazil", 5, ["Sao Paulo", "Rio de Janeiro"])
# DO NOT modify the travel_log directly. The goal is to create a function that modifies it.

# Example Input
# Brazil
# 5
# ["Sao Paulo", "Rio de Janeiro"]
# Example Output
# I've been to Brazil 5 times.
# My favourite city was Sao Paulo.
# Hint
# Look at the function call above to see what the name of the function should be.

# The inputs for the function are positional arguments. The order is very important.

# Feel free to choose your own parameter names.

country = input() # Add country name
visits = int(input()) # Number of visits
list_of_cities = eval(input()) # create list from formatted string
